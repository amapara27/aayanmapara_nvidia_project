This project uses AI and Machine Learning to warn the user of any harmful mosquitos landing on the skin. This uses a re-trained model and works with the camera. The three mosquito species used in this dataset, all contain deadly diseases such as Zika and Malaria. This model can prevent people in third world countries from suffering, and even dying. The code used for this model is in the master branch. The dataset used is here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/naiborhujosua/mosquito-on-human-skin
